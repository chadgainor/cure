"If I can take a moment, I would like to speak directly to one person known to watch this show, or at least clips of this show, President Trump.
Mr. President, I know you, like millions of Americans, are eager to have the nation go back to some semblance of normal. One of the questions the American people need answered for that to happen responsibly: What's the plan?

Continue social distancing. Continue being vigilant about personal hygene. Be cognacent of surfaces you touch. Wear a mask when in public. Mass-testing will be possible when enough of the automatic testing devices have been produced to send one to every hospital. Or we could all spit in a bag and mail it to Trump, then he could have the CDC check US and let US know what our results are. These are uncharted waters, and a lot of smart people around him are doing what they can to help US out of this. 

Is there a plan for widespread testing of every American so as to isolate the virus -- the way other countries have done? When will there be enough tests for that to happen? How will they be administered? Who will pay for the tests and the results? Who will notify us as to whether we've tested positive or not and what to do then?

A biotech company was showing off an automatic testing device last week, I believe; obviously the sooner those can be manufactured and sent to every city, the better. Or we could just spit in a bag and mail it to Trump, then he could have the CDC check US and let US know what our results are. These are uncharted waters, and a lot of smart people are doing what they can to help US out of this. 
    
Is there a plan to make sure doctors and nurses and health care professionals finally are able to get the personal protective equipment or PPE that they need? Those health care workers are quite literally dying while they try to protect our society and save lives and they're -- they are begging for PPE. They don't need to be told that their governors or their hospital directors are doing anything wrong by trying to get those supplies to protect their lives while they try to save our lives. They need to know that there's a plan to get them the supplies they need.

We need to be able to manufacture everything we need to have, in America. We can't rely on other countries, when it comes to having the supplies we need to save lives. In some ways, this will be good for US. Companies are converting to producing essential medical equipment, and people are using 3D printing technology to manufacture goods on a small scale, for local facilities, which is cool to see, but given our current dependence on international manufacturing for supplies, we weren't prepared to handle a situation of this magnitude. 

Governors and mayors right now are literally bidding against each other and against the federal government to try to get these supplies. This is escalating the prices and causing confusion and unnecessary bidding competition. Is there a plan to stop that? What is it?

I'd say withdraw all the state orders, have FEMA place the orders, and have the supplies shipped directly to states. There should be no national stockpile, everything we have should be in the field right now. 

What about ventilators? New York City Mayor de Blasio said today would be the day his city could run out. Governor Edwards said his city or state could run out on Thursday. Is there a plan to expedite the manufacture of ventilators? It's still not clear whether you have fully utilized the Defense Production Act. Have you? Are any companies being compelled by the US government to make ventilators and when will they be made? When can hospitals get them?


What about the cotton masks that the CDC is now suggesting that we all wear when we leave our homes? Is someone manufacturing them? How can we get them? Is there a plan?
    
Stay home. If you have to leave the house, wear a mask and wash your hands if you touch anything. If you don't have a mask, you can make one, or if you know someone who's making them, you can get one from them. 

This is an unpresidented thing. But the best thing you can do is stay home, for the time being.

Definitely don't go to Church on Easter.

Also use this time at home to make some improvements.

Clean up your act a little bit. 

Start gardening.

Excersize. 

Work on unfinished projects.

The ecnomy should remain paused for the forseeable future, at least until everyone's been tested; people with the antibodies should be safe to return to work, but I'd verify that with Dr. Fauci if I were you. 

We could use this opportunity to develop a UBI system; we should  and tweak the healthcare system,
